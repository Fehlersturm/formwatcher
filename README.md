# Formwatcher

The formwatcher is a tool to easily improve forms with javascript.

It is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so that every form remains intact without the use of Javascript.


## Features

The **main features** include:

- Validation
- Decorators (Turn a simple select input field into an image selector, or a font selector)
- AJAX conversion (Turn a form into an AJAX call automatically)
- Simple html attribute configuration that is W3C valid.
- It's very easy to create your own validators / decorators.
- ...plenty more.


Please refer to the README/ folder for instructions on how to use and extend formwatcher.
