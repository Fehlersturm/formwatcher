# Formwatcher

## What does formwatcher actually do?

Formwatcher attaches itself to a form, and improves the user interaction with you input fields.

A few of the main goals of formwatcher are:

- Be completely unobtrusive (your forms still work without JS)
- Provide sensible defaults so you won't have to configure much
- Provide the best user experience possible


Other main features include:

- Validation
- Decorators (Turn a simple select input field into an image selector, or a font selector)
- AJAX conversion (Turn a form into an AJAX call automatically)
- Simple html [attribute configuration](attribute_configuration.md) that is W3C valid.
- It's very easy to create your own validators / decorators.
- ...plenty more.
